//A guard statement, like an if statement, executes statements depending on the Boolean value of an expression. You use a guard statement to require that a condition must be true in order for the code after the guard statement to be executed. Unlike an if statement, a guard statement always has an else clause—the code inside the else clause is executed if the condition isn’t true.’

//guard는 항상 else 문이 있고, guard의 조건이 false 인 경우 else 문이 실행이 된다.
