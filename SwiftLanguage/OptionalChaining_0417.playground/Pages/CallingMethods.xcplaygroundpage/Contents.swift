//‘If you call this method on an optional value with optional chaining, the method’s return type will be Void?, not Void, because return values are always of an optional type when called through optional chaining. This enables you to use an if statement to check whether it was possible to call the printNumberOfRooms() method, even though the method doesn’t itself define a return value. Compare the return value from the printNumberOfRooms call against nil to see if the method call was successful:
